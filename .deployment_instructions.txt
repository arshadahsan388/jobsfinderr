Azure App Service Deployment Steps:

1. Make sure your project has these files:
   - requirements.txt
   - runtime.txt
   - startup.txt (startup command)
   - app.py (main Flask app)

2. Push your code to GitHub (or zip upload).

3. Go to Azure Portal > App Service > Create new Web App:
   - Runtime stack: Python 3.11
   - Region: (choose closest)

4. Deployment:
   - Source: GitHub (or local zip)
   - Build: Azure will auto-install requirements.txt
   - Startup command: gunicorn app:app

5. After deployment, your Flask app will be live on Azure URL.

6. For static files, make sure 'static/' and 'templates/' folders are present.

7. If you need environment variables, set them in App Service > Configuration.

For any error, check App Service logs in Azure Portal.
